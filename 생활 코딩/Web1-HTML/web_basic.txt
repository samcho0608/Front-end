Internet vs. Web
 ***Internet contains many programs(email, file share, streaming, online
    game, etc.) and Web is one them.

1960: Invention of Internet
    Why:
      - U.S., worried about nuclear war, realized that there is an issue
        with their communication system; all communications will fail once
        main communication center falls.
      - Internet is literally net of communication with multiple connections
        at each node. Thus, even if one fell, it wouldn't affect the entire
        network of communication.
      - was not available to the public.
1990: Invention of Web
      - created in Switzerland, where CERN(the biggest scientific equipment 
        in the world) is located.
      - Tim Berners-Lee : the inventor of Web with its forerunning program
        "Enquire"
      - info.cern.ch : the first website in the world
      - opened up Internet to the public.
